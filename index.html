            About Kevin
          </h2>
          <p>
            Kevin’s clients can count having a smart, efficient agent on their
            side who is knowledgeable of the relevant markets, and understands
            very well how to work and interact with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Trustworthiness is the most important thing to me,” he says. “I
            want every client to feel confident that I am fully dedicated to
            their needs, and will work tirelessly on their behalf to help them
            get the home and value they deserve.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Kevin is extremely pleasant to work with and an eloquent
            communicator. He is further appreciated for his honest approach,
            keen attention to detail, and great client service. With a
            background in law, he possesses strong analytical and advocacy
            skills as well, which are invaluable assets for navigating and
            negotiating real estate transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This native of Garden City, Long Island studied Political Science at
            Penn State University and went on to graduate from St. John’s
            University School of Law. Kevin worked at a title insurance company
            prior to and during law school, and then for a civil litigation firm
            in downtown Manhattan. He lives in the Upper East Side, and
            specializes in residential sales and rentals in all Manhattan
            neighborhoods, from Tribeca and Flatiron to the Upper West Side and
            beyond.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the personal side, music is his passion. Kevin plays guitar and
            writes songs. He also loves history and travel. Volunteering means a
            lot to him, and he tries to get involved as much as possible by
            giving blood, donating to various charities, and participating in
            fundraisers. Kevin has been a Big Brother the past two years which
            has been particularly rewarding.
